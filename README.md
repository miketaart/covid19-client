## Instructions
Option 1 - `git clone [this repo]`.
Option 2 `Download this repo as a .zip file and extract locally`.

2. Run `npm install`.

3. Run `npm run dev` in the same folder to concurrently start the React app and the JSON-Server.

### Task 
- **Develop a small SPA to demonstrate your level of skill, passion and view on today's world of web!**

**Challenges**
- The biggest challenge for me during this assessment was the freedom to choose to build whatever I wanted. In order to impress someone you tend to overexaggerate by keep adding functionalities without keeping an eye on the quality of your code. I myself noticed that my class components, for example the survey and the dashboard components, became way too spaghetti and by the time the deadline closed in on me, I realized there was no time anymore to refactor my code. 
- Another little challenge I got stuck on was figuring out which API I wanted to use. In the end I want for a public one of which I was sure there are no request limitations. 
- Aside from this I also tried to implement some coding conventions and technologies. Following the coding standard provided by BEM for example was something I had to get used to. By the end I think I got the hang of it but as you might noticed: in some stylesheets BEM was not implemented correctly.


### Reflections
This coding challenge was really enjoyable, it pushed me to dive into some deeper React knowledge I forgot about and gave me the chance to be creative. I feel that while doing this challenge I got a real feel for what the Creative Frontend Developer role would look like and I feel that it would be a really good fit for me and I could really excel at. I also learned to plan my next projects better by spending less time on coming up with something creative and above all spending less time on quantity and go for quality code instead. On top of this I plan to learn React Hooks to prevent these big class components in the future. 

My process for debugging is as  follows: console.log the issue, if that was too vague or the error did no present itself clearly I moved to using the Chrome debugger.

## Timeline
Started on 19/10/2020 (all of this had to be done in the evening since I work during the day)

### Monday
Refine idea (Covid related app) and search for usable API's. 

### Tuesday
Playing around with the API's and filter useful data.

### Wednesday
Design and develop MVP Covid dashboard and display data I wanted to use.

### Thursday
Got sick so started coding fairly late in the evening. Finished most of the dashboard and created repo for assessment

### Friday
Started developing the app during work and in the evening and at the end of the day I had some basic components working.

### Saturday
Refined structure of app and watched some tutorials on React Router. App reloads much smoother than before. 

### Sunday
Highly stressful but also pleasant day. Spent most of the day on styling and halfway I decided to change the layout of the app. Luckily my components where pretty reusable so without a lot of effort I was able to change it to something I was satisfied with. At the very end I was able to add some Form validation as well.

### Monday (coming)
Will try to deploy to share the app with friends who were asking why I react(ed) (pun intended) a bit slow to their messages.
